How to use

The target pc must have the auto insert notification enabled for the cd-rom

Record an empty cd with the autorun.inf and the compiled exe in the root directory.

Now suppose that the target pc is running a password-protected screensaver
open the cd-rom door and put the recorded cd in..
close the door and wait for the system to run the cd

BoOm!! The screensaver is terminated... we used no password to log in :)
